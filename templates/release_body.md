## DESCRIPTION

Integrates Google Play’s **In-App Updates** with GameMaker so players can update your game without leaving it. The extension checks whether an update is available, launches the official Play update UI (flexible or immediate), reports progress and status back to your game, and safely manages listeners and lifecycle so you can keep users on the latest version with minimal friction.

## FEATURES 

- Checks Google Play for update availability and metadata.
- Supports both **flexible** and **immediate** update flows.
- Launches the native, trusted Google Play update UI.
- Reports download progress and install status to your game.
- Applies completed flexible updates from within the app.
- Manages listener registration and cleanup automatically.
- Designed to work smoothly with GameMaker’s async event model.

## DOCUMENTATION

The full documentation of the API is included in the extension asset (included files).
